## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Use strict type checking
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use semicolons
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing Requirements

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies

### Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update type definitions
- Include usage examples

## Project Structure

```

├── config/          # Configuration files (including AI settings)
├── database/        # Database connection and models
├── services/        # Core business logic
│   ├── FraudDetectionService.ts    # Main fraud detection
│   └── AIFraudAnalysisService.ts   # AI analysis via Groq API
├── tests/          # Test files
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/          # Utility functions
└── index.ts        # AI-enhanced demo application
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- fraud-detection.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests with `describe`
- Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` for setup/cleanup
- Mock external dependencies (especially AI APIs)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- **AI Testing**: Mock Groq API responses for consistent testing
- **Performance Testing**: Test AI analysis timing and fallback mechanisms

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('FeatureName', () => {
  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should do something when condition is met', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = 'test';
      
      // Act
      const result = method(input);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe('expected');
    });
  });
});
```
